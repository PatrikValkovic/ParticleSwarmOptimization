# Particle Swarm Optimisation

This repository includes description and comparison of different Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms - specifically Standard Particle Swarm Optimization 2006, Standard Particle Swarm Optimization 2011 and Fuzzy Self-Tuning Particle Swarm Optimization (2017).

I show basic ideas behind, what are particle topologies, show implementations of standard POS algorithms and evaluate their performance.

You can view content of this repository in [PatrikValkovic/ParticleSwarmOptimization](https://github.com/PatrikValkovic/ParticleSwarmOptimization/) repository or online [https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/ParticleSwarmOptimization](https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/ParticleSwarmOptimization). The online version contains particles movement in gifs, not included in the repository because of file sizes.

---------

Description of files and source code is in [introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/PatrikValkovic/ParticleSwarmOptimization/blob/master/introduction.ipynb) notebook or [online](https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/ParticleSwarmOptimization/introduction.html). You can use that as reference if you want to evaluate your own approach.

Main content is in the [main.ipynb](https://github.com/PatrikValkovic/ParticleSwarmOptimization/blob/master/main.ipynb) notebook or [online](https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/ParticleSwarmOptimization/main.html). I explain Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, compare the implementations and write my thoughts.

Finally, you can find complete comparison using all BBOB functions using all dimensions and all approaches in the [complete.ipynb](https://github.com/PatrikValkovic/ParticleSwarmOptimization/blob/master/complete.ipynb) notebook or [online](https://patrikvalkovic.github.io/ParticleSwarmOptimization/complete.html) (without gifs this time).
