For example, when fish in the swarm see food, it will swim toward it. Otherwise, the fish keeps the same direction as its neighboors. As some wish change their direction toward the food, the rest of the swarm would follow them. As a result, the whole swarm reach the food and, in case there is no competetion between individuals (enough food for each one), each fish feed itself. \n",

    "Firstly, the topology may change after each iteration or may remain static the whole time. In the first approach, each particle will eventually obtain information from all other particles - and thus can compare it's best known value with all the particles. Constant $K$ denotes how many particles inform each iteration and was set t $K=3$ in the paper. Because $K$ is quiet small, the problem is getting stuck in the local optimum is significantly reduced. In the second approach, the particle doesn't know about rest of the search space, unless some of it's neighbor reach it. This prevent swarm to get stuck in the local optima, but reduce amount of information each particle obtain a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to decide how the topology would look like. First (and deterministic) approach proposed by the paper was called \"ring topology\". When we index particles, the ring topology for particle $i$ is $\\left\\{i+1\\ mod(N), i+2\\ mod(N), \\dots, i+K\\ mod(N)\\right\\}$ where $N$ is number of particles. Another proposition was \"adaptive random topology\", where each particle picks three other particles at random and inform them about it's value (note that this topology in its static version is same as the previous one). Another topology is \"von Neumann\" topology, that you can see bellow (I will not discuss it here anymore, as it is just modification of the ring topology). Finally, we may simple use $K$ nearest neighboors and inform them (or take information from them)."

Let's take for example particle at good spot and it's neighborhood of very bad particles. Although all particles in the neighborhood have worse value than the current particle, it will try to move into worse position. That's not very fortune and with small modification in the source code we could fix this issue, however I will take different approach and allow particles to remember best global position $b_g$ (best position obtained from other particles) and best local position $b_l$ (best position of the particle itself) over the whole evaluation.\n",

The problem of differential evolution is that the individuals are \"static\" - when all individuals reach some region, there is no way to get out of it. That is not necesarry true for the particles - even if they reach the best known optimum, they usually have some velocity left. That cause them to continue according to velocity and allow them to explore parameter space around. There is very low probability that particle would stop moving.\n",
