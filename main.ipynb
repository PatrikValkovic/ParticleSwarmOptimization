For example, when fish in the swarm see food, it will swim toward it. Otherwise, the fish keeps the same direction as its neighbors. As some wish change their direction toward the food, the rest of the swarm would follow them. As a result, the whole swarm reaches the food, and, in case there is no competition between individuals (enough food for each one), each fish feed itself.\n",

The definition of the neighborhood (sometimes called topology) is not defined precisely, and there are many approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the topology may change after each iteration or may remain static the whole time. In the first approach, each particle will eventually obtain information from all other particles - and thus can compare their value with all the particles. Constant $K$ denotes how many particles to inform each iteration and was set to $K=3$ in the paper. Because $K$ is quite small, the problem is getting stuck in the local optimum is significantly reduced. In the second approach, the particle doesn't know about the rest of the search space, unless some of it's neighbor reach it. This prevents swarm to stuck in the local optima but reduce the amount of information each particle obtains a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to decide how the topology would look like. The first (and deterministic) approach proposed by the paper was called \"ring topology\". When we index particles, the ring topology for particle $i$ is $\\left\\{i+1\\ mod(N), i+2\\ mod(N), \\dots, i+K\\ mod(N)\\right\\}$ where $N$ is number of particles. Another proposition was \"adaptive random topology\", where each particle picks three other particles at random and inform them about its value (note that this topology in its static version is same as the previous one). Another topology is \"von Neumann\", that you can see below (I will not discuss it here anymore, as it is just modification of the ring topology). Finally, we may simply use $K$ nearest neighbors and inform them (or take information from them)."

That's not very fortunate, and with a small modification in the source code we could fix this issue, however, I will take a different approach and allow particles to remember best global position $b_g$ (best position obtained from other particles) and best local position $b_l$ (best position of the particle itself) over the whole evaluation.\n",
